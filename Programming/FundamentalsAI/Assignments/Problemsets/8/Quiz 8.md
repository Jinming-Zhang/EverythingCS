## Question #1
#### Model Based
needs a transition model T and a reward function R, whether is predefined by the environment or estimated through exploration, to run the MDP and compute the optimal policy/values of each state.

#### Model Free
Doesn't need a transition model T and a reward function R to learn the optimal value of state s.
## Question #2
2.875
## Question #3
1,3 are true.
## Question #4
if the state values are default to 0 and the terminal states do have values then true.
if we don't have value for every state including terminal states, then false.
## Question #5
3 is true.
