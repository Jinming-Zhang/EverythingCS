# Rationality
Four things can be used to mesure the rationality of an agent's action:
- Performance measure after the action.
- The agent's percept sequence to date.
- Agent's prior knowledge of the environment.
- Actions that the agent can perform.

# Definition of a Rational Agent
>For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its **performance mesure**, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.

A rational agent has a function that will make the action that maximize the performance measure for all the possible cases based on what it has learned.
