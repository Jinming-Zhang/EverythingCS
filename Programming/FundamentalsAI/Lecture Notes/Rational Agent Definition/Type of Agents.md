# Four different approach of AI
- Thinking Humanly
	- Cognitive Modeling (Simulate human's thought, how human brain works)
- Acting Humanly
	- Turing Test
- Thinking Rationally
	- Laws of thought (logic thinking)
	- Two Problems
		- uneasy to take informal thinking to formal term by logical notations
		- solving problems **in principle** is different than **in practice**.
- **Acting Rationally** (Rational Agent)
	- acts to achieve best outcome, or as best as possible
	- takes the best possible action in a situation
	- follows mathmatical rules/proofs?

# Comparasion between thinking and acting rationally

- Thinking rationally (**correct inferences**) can be part of the process of acting rationally. 
- Thinking rationally does not always 
- Some rational action doesn't require rational thinking (instincts).
- Thinking rationally (correct inferences) is just one of several possible options for acheiving rational result.
- Acting Rationally is better suited for scientific development.

## Advantages of Rationally Agent Approach (Acting Rationally)
- Can be more generalized


The agent function is an abstract mathematical description;
the agent program is a concrete implementation, running within some physical system.
