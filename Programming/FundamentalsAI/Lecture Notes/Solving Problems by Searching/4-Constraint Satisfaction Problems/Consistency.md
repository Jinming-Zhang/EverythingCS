## Node Consistency
All the values in the variable's domain satisfy the variable's unary constraint.
## Arc Consistency
All the values in the variable's domain satisfy the variable's binary constraint.

>Arc consistency involves two variables

For two variables Xi and Xj, there are values in their domains Di and Dj that satisfy the binary constraint on these two varialbes.
