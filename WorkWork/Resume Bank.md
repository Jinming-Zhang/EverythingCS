# Skills
#### OOP/C\#
- Two-year full time working experience as Unity Developer, acquired advanced C\#/Object-Oriented programming skills by applying various design patterns as appropriate and wrote well-structured code for various systems such as game play, UI, and server communication.

#### C++
- Solid C/C++ skills gained by completing multiple academic projects that require memory management and high performance with high quality, and currently taking a course that builds a game engine using C++ from scratch.

#### Web
- Great web programming skills acquired from completing Web Development course, self-learned React, SCSS, developed and deployed personal website with customized RESTful API using NodeJS, MongoDB, AWS, etc...  

#### Version Control
- Adequate experiences in version control tools, skilled in GitHub commands and work flow such as branching out features, merge/rebase with other branches and making pull request to upload the changes.

#### AI
- Strong foundation in AI gained from completing various school projects using algorithms such as classical search, constraint satisfaction/optimization, and using Bellman equation for reinforcement learning.

#### Linux
#### Unity
- Two-year full time working experience as Unity Developer, applied various design patterns as appropriate and wrote well-structured scripts for various systems such as game play, UI, and server communication. Also familiar with Unity tools such as animation and timeline.

#### Game Dev
- Participated in multiple game jams, collaborated with people from different time zones, effectively managed project using git and delivered decent games in limited time.

#### Teamwork
- Excellent teamwork and communication skills acquired from communicating with designers and testers to deliver features as expected, as well as updating project progress regularly and keep the team synchronized.

#### Problem Solving
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills developed from breaking large code base into smaller tasks during major code refactoring, as well as fixing various bugs by tracing through the code base and identifying potential logical errors.  

- Great passion for new technology, self-learned blender through winter break, and immediately participated in the following game jam using a self-made character model.

# Work Experience
- Investigated and solved various bugs in \href{https://www.gotconquest.com/}{\textit{Game of Thrones: Conquest (GOTC)}} project by debugging through code, compared with similar working features and applied fix with same code structure as the code base.
- Contributed to major code refactoring by analyzing existing code structure, composing UML diagrams, comparing designs and implementing new design piece by piece.
- Effectively communicated with designers and testers, and implemented/updated game UI and features as expected.
- Exposed to and worked with different tech stacks such as Unity, Jenkins, Git, AWS, PlayFab.

# Projects
###  Build Game Engine
- Using SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library and C++ to build various game engine systems from scratch, such as resource manager, math library, sprite atlas and physics.
- Applying different design patterns to make the engine well structured, such as Component pattern for managing game objects, Observer pattern for communicating between different components etc.
- Solid understanding of memory management in C++, using different type of pointers as appropriate and carefully setup destructor for classes to avoid memory leak.

###  Inconceivable Detective Madness
- Efficiently programed all the features of the game including game play, UI and audio etc., also applied different design patterns to make the code base adapting to changes.
- Effectively collaborated with four people from three different time zones. Set up and managed GitHub repository to ensured the project was on the right track.
- Elegantly identified high-priority tasks and prioritized them reasonably to deliver a decent game within a limited time.
