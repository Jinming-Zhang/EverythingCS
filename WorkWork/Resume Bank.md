#### Linux
#### Unity
- Two-year full time working experience as Unity Developer, applied various design patterns as appropriate and wrote well-structured scripts for various systems such as game play, UI, and server communication. Also familiar with Unity tools such as animation and timeline.

#### Game Dev
- Participated in multiple game jams, collaborated with people from different time zones, effectively managed project using git and delivered decent games in limited time.

#### Teamwork
- Excellent teamwork and communication skills acquired from communicating with designers and testers to deliver features as expected, as well as updating project progress regularly and keep the team synchronized.

#### Problem Solving
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills developed from breaking large code base into smaller tasks during major code refactoring, as well as fixing various bugs by tracing through the code base and identifying potential logical errors.  

- Great passion for new technology, self-learned blender through winter break, and immediately participated in the following game jam using a self-made character model.

# Work Experience
- Investigated and solved various bugs in \href{https://www.gotconquest.com/}{\textit{Game of Thrones: Conquest (GOTC)}} project by debugging through code, compared with similar working features and applied fix with same code structure as the code base.
- Contributed to major code refactoring by analyzing existing code structure, composing UML diagrams, comparing designs and implementing new design piece by piece.
- Effectively communicated with designers and testers, and implemented/updated game UI and features as expected.
- Exposed to and worked with different tech stacks such as Unity, Jenkins, Git, AWS, PlayFab.

# Projects
###  Build Game Engine
- Using SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library and C++ to build various game engine systems from scratch, such as resource manager, math library, sprite atlas and physics.
- Applying different design patterns to make the engine well structured, such as Component pattern for managing game objects, Observer pattern for communicating between different components etc.
- Solid understanding of memory management in C++, using different type of pointers as appropriate and carefully setup destructor for classes to avoid memory leak.

###  Inconceivable Detective Madness
- Efficiently programed all the features of the game including game play, UI and audio etc., also applied different design patterns to make the code base adapting to changes.
- Effectively collaborated with four people from three different time zones. Set up and managed GitHub repository to ensured the project was on the right track.
- Elegantly identified high-priority tasks and prioritized them reasonably to deliver a decent game within a limited time.



# Cover Letter
### Sample Opening
I am writing to express my interest in the [C++ Game Developer] position at [Company Name]. I worked as a full-time Unity developer for two years and developed strong programing and teamworking skills. Currently I am a Master of Science in Computer Science student at the Northeastern University Vancouver Campus. As a motivated and skilled software developer with a passion for game development, I believe I will be a strong candidate for this position.

### OOP /C\# Paragraph
During my two years career as a full time Unity developer, I gained efficient experiences in OOP programing and C\#. In the major code refactoring of our project, I helped improving the project structure by applying various design patterns as appropriate, such as using template pattern to sort UI components, using strategy pattern to alter game rules during run time, and using observer pattern to decouple responsibilities between game components.

### OOP /C++ Paragraph
I also have solid foundation in C++. I have completed multiple C++ project in my undergraduate such as writing different ray tracers and path finding algorithms in C++. Currently, I am taking a course on building game engine using C++, and have learned different systems in a game engine and design patterns that implements the system, such as using singleton for resource manager and component pattern for game components. By the end of the semester, I will have a great understanding of the underlying structure of a game engine and a solid foundation in using C++.

### AI Paragraph
Other than programming skills, I also have a strong computer science background. I completed various courses such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and developed excellent algorithm skills. For example, I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to train the AI agent efficiently through reinforcement learning. Moreover, I applied Naive Bayes algorithm and developed a simple spam filter model. I am also taking an algorithm class, I will have a deeper understanding of dynamic programming and other advanced algorithms that can help me be a successful computer scientist.

### Scripting Paragraph
I am familiar with scripting languages such as Python and JavaScript. I like to use Python to help me with small tasks. For instance, I used Python and Selenium and wrote a simple script that helped me found an early driving test time slot. I also took online courses on JavaScript and ReactJs and developed my portfolio website. 


### Teamwork Paragraph
Furthermore, I have great teamwork and communication skills. While I was working as a Unity developer, I regularly communicated with designers to update the progress of the features and clear any confusions. I'm also skilled in maintain a clean commit history using Git by creating a separate branch for each feature or bug fix, re-organize commit history and resolve conflicts using rebase and finally upload the changes with a pull request. 

collaboration with people from different countries through multiple game jams. During a one-week-long game jam, I worked with four people from three different time zones, where I analyzed the requirements and came up with a good approximation of the scale of the game, communicated with teammates regularly, and ensured everyone was working on desired features and delivered a decent game with a tight deadline.
